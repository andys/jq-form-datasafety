jq-form-datasafety v0.1
-----------------------

The standard way to prevent users accidentally navigating away from a page
before they've submitted a form with unsaved data, is to use:

  window.onbeforeunload = "Warning message";

This snippet of code enhances that technique with the following features:

* Checks if form values have changed values versus their initial state and
  only fires the warning in that case.

* Adds a CSS class ("data_safety_warning") to input boxes which changed

* Only operates on forms tagged with a CSS class called "datasafe", and only
  on forms and inputs which are visible.

* Works OK with AJAX forms, by inserting itself as the first event handler
  to fire on form submit.



Requirements
------------

* jQuery 1.4 (may work in 1.3)

* Tested in Firefox 3.6, IE7
